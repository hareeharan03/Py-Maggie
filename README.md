# Data Preprocessing Web Application

## Overview

- **Project Description:** This repository hosts a zero-code web application designed for comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning. It offers an interactive interface tailored for users with minimal coding experience.

- **Motivation:** While existing zero-code platforms, such as Azure Machine Learning, provide basic data preprocessing capabilities, there's a gap in tools that can perform advanced statistical analyses to produce refined datasets suitable for training machine learning models.

- **Implementation:** The application features a user-friendly front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an appealing and intuitive user experience. Its back-end is powered by Flask, a robust framework, to execute data preprocessing tasks based on user inputs. To enhance usability, detailed descriptions and recommendations guide users through each step, even if they have limited technical expertise.

**Please note:** This project is currently in the development phase, and further enhancements to the interface are planned.
